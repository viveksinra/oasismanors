Retirement homes, on the other hand, provide residents with an age-restricted community. The two property types differ primarily in the level of care that is given. Moving into a retirement village or nursing home enables these seniors to enjoy their time without having to worry about the hassles of everyday chores."},{ques:"Are there standards that retirement homes must abide by?", ans:"Yes. The Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority (RHRA) is an organization that establishes and measures standards for retirement residences in the province. All Sharon Village Home Care properties meet or exceed these standards."},{ques:"How much does it cost to live in a retirement village?", ans:"Prices vary based on the location and the services offered. In most cases, fees are specific to the retirement residence and to the client themselves. Please contact the Sharon Village retirement residence of your choice for more information on accommodation costs."},  {ques:"What should I consider when looking for a retirement home?",ans:"This depends a lot on your personal preferences. The following is a list of criteria to consider when looking at potential retirement options:",list:[{point:"Accommodations: Consider things like wheelchair accessibility, whether or not a kitchenette is available, housekeeping and laundry services, etc."},{point:"Leisure activities: Be sure to enquire about outdoor spaces, common areas, recreational programming, onsite amenities (like a salon or spa), and worship services."},{point:"Health and assisted living services: Always be sure to check staff credentials and facility safety protocols. If you require more in-depth assisted living services, you may wish to consider one of our Long-Term Care facilities."}] }, {ques:"How do I talk to my loved one about retirement living?",ans:"It is never too soon to start this conversation with a loved one. Making the transition from independent living to a retirement community does not have to be difficult; however it will take some adjusting to. Start the conversation by asking your loved one about their future plans and needs. Be supportive and enthusiastic about their options. By keeping a positive outlook and assisting your loved one with their research and planning, you will help them feel more confident and comfortable with their decision."}, ])
